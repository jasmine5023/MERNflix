# MERNflix - Netflix Clone
MERNflix is a Netflix clone project that aims to replicate the basic functionalities of Netflix, providing a landing page and a sign-in button for users.

# Features
Landing Page: Displays a basic layout similar to Netflix's landing page.
Sign-In Button: Allows users to access the sign-in functionality.
Technologies Used-
HTML would define the structure of different pages (homepage, movie details page, user profile page, etc.) and include elements like buttons, forms, and containers to hold content.

CSS would be responsible for styling the HTML elements to make the site visually appealing, including layout design, color schemes, typography, and responsive design for various devices.

JavaScript would handle the dynamic functionality. For instance, it might include things like:

Making AJAX requests to retrieve movie data from a server (or local storage).
Implementing user authentication and managing user sessions.
Creating a video player using HTML5 video tags and controlling playback features (play, pause, seek).
Handling user interactions like clicks on movie titles, play buttons, or adding movies to a favorites list.
This approach might require more effort compared to using frameworks or libraries like React or Express.js, as developers would need to handle more low-level functionalities and interactions manually. However, it offers more flexibility in terms of customization and understanding the fundamental building blocks of web development.
