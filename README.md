#  Netflix site with HTML & CSS
MERNflix is a project designed to replicate the functionality and user interface of Netflix using the HTML, CSS and JS and. The goal of MERNflix is to create a streaming platform with similar features to Netflix, including user authentication, a vast collection of videos or movies, browsing categories, user profiles, and streaming capabilities.

HTML would define the structure of different pages (homepage, movie details page, user profile page, etc.) and include elements like buttons, forms, and containers to hold content.

CSS would be responsible for styling the HTML elements to make the site visually appealing, including layout design, color schemes, typography, and responsive design for various devices.

JavaScript would handle the dynamic functionality. For instance, it might include things like:

Making AJAX requests to retrieve movie data from a server (or local storage).
Implementing user authentication and managing user sessions.
Creating a video player using HTML5 video tags and controlling playback features (play, pause, seek).
Handling user interactions like clicks on movie titles, play buttons, or adding movies to a favorites list.
This approach might require more effort compared to using frameworks or libraries like React or Express.js, as developers would need to handle more low-level functionalities and interactions manually. However, it offers more flexibility in terms of customization and understanding the fundamental building blocks of web development.
